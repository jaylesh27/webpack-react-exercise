Starter repo for webpackproject that is part of the Webpack 2 course on Udemy.  If you want to download it using git, copy paste the link that is presented to you, then run the following at your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/StephenGrider/WebpackProject.git
cd WebpackProject
npm install
```

This repo is updated with my own additions with the webpack features learned about in the Udemy Webpack 2 course.
